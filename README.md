A messenger app created using AngularJS and javascript.

How to Run?

    run install.sh to install all dependencies 

Why I used dependencies?

     mobile-angular-ui ---  for mobile layout
     angular-emoji-filter --- to show emoji's in the text
     angular-emoji-filter-hd ---- to show emoji's in the text HD version
     angular-sanitize  ---- emoji required this so installed.
